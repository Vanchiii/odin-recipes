    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>I learned how to make creamy chicken Alfredo from my dad who has always been an incredible cook and amazing teacher. Chicken Alfredo was always my favorite. A lot of the recipes I see that are worthwhile are too much work because you have to make your own sauce, and those that don't have you make your own have no flavor. This recipe shows you how to take plain, bland, store-made sauce and make it more than restaurant-worthy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 (16 ounce) packages thin spaghetti</li>
        <li>4 (15 ounce) jars Alfredo sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded Parmesan cheese <strong>(Optional)</strong></li>
        <li>2 cups chopped broccoli <strong>(Optional)</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until no longer pink in the centers and juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook thin spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, add Alfredo sauce to the chicken along with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion, basil, salt, black pepper, onion powder, and cayenne. Bring to a slight boil; stir in Parmesan cheese. Cook mixture until cheese is melted and you are able to lift a spoon out of the sauce without cheese hanging onto it, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes. Add broccoli to sauce.</li>
        <li>Drain cooked pasta. Scoop into individual serving bowls and pour sauce on top.</li>
    </ol>
